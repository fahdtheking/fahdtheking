⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that AI systems have been trained to recognize and generate human faces so accurately that they can now create realistic images of people who don't even exist? While this technology is incredibly impressive, it also raises concerns about privacy, identity theft, and the potential misuse of AI-generated content. It's a reminder of the importance of ethical AI development and responsible use of technology.
